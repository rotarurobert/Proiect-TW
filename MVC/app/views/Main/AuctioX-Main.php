        <p>At over five metres in length the <b>M8 Gran Coupe</b> is a big car, with a roofline a little higher than that of the 8 Series Coupe, but the relatively low-line bonnet and the sloping roofline disguise its overall proportions, and every Gran Coupe gets the swollen arches at the rear that give the sides a ‘coke bottle’ effect. There’s an extra crease line in the side profile too, which BMW’s designers say give this car a more powerful aesthetic compared to the softer, more sensuous curves of the coupe version. The ‘duck tail’ spoiler integrated into the boot lid is another element standard across all Gran Coupe models, made possible thanks to the section being made from plastic. The four doors have frameless windows, and the ‘Hofmeister kink’ at the end of the side glass graphic is a milled part, not the usual extruded piece, enabling a more precisely detailed form.As for the elements specific to the M despartment version, these begin at the front end with the familiar three-intake M front bumper, and also include on this concept version yellow daytime running lights. Inspired by the yellow headlamps of the GTE-class M8 racer, BMW told evo the company is looking at bringing them into production as a key identifier of the M version. There are also wider front wheel arches to accommodate the bigger wheels and brakes you’d expect on an M car, plus the familiar CFRP roof and quad tail pipes at the rear. The wheels, too, are a new development for the M8, with the lighter surfaces the result of milling not painting and polishing, giving the wheels a diamond effect on the move as opposed to the usual rotating disc look.</p>

      <p>The <b>iPhone X</b> – or <b>iPhone 10</b> – is a hugely important device for Apple. Not only does its release coincide with the 10th anniversary of arguably the most important tech product of the past decade, but it’s the first iPhone in four years to undergo a major redesign.It’s also the best iPhone I’ve ever used – but it comes at a cost. A pretty hefty one.
The iPhone X saw a big change to the long-established iPhone formula, and currently, it’s difficult to say if it’s been a complete success. Having used the phone solidly since its release, my thoughts regarding the iPhone X seem to change on a weekly basis.I remain a huge fan of the design and build of this handset, especially the precision and splendid finish. My device has remained in a case since its unboxing – either Apple’s official leather one or Twelve South’s Relaxed Leather case – and as a result the device is scratch-free. Others in the Trusted Reviews office, who decided against using a case, have paid the price; the stainless steel rim, in particular, is prone to scratches.

      <p>The <b>Galaxy S9</b> retains this familiar overall look, which is hardly something to complain about when you consider that, a year on, the S8 is still one of slickest phones around.
        The S9 sees the bezel thickness above and below the display reduce further. In addition, the fingerprint scanner has been moved to a more suitable location beneath the camera, rather than being tucked tightly beside it. However, it still feels a tad on the small side, and there’s noticeable lag as it jumps you to the homescreen.

  The metal and glass body retains its curved display, IP68 water-resistance rating and microSD card slot. The aluminium rim has been strengthened and the Gorilla Glass 5 coating the screen has been thickened. As someone who smashed a Galaxy S8 after knocking it off a bed onto a carpeted floor, this is a welcome upgrade.

  You’ll find a dedicated Bixby button below the volume rocker, with the lock-switch on the other side. I dislike the fact that the extra button can only be used with a virtual assistant – I turned it off completely after a day of use – but Bixby remains a huge push for Samsung and, hopefully, it might get a bit better when version 2.0 hits later in the year.
